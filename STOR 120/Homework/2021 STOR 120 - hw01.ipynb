    "In lecture, we counted the number of times that the literary characters were named in each chapter of the classic book, [*Little Women*](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/3/1/literary-characters). In computer science, the word \"character\" also refers to a letter, digit, space, or punctuation mark; any single element of a text. The following code generates a scatter plot in which each dot corresponds to a chapter of *Little Women*. The horizontal position of a dot measures the number of periods in the chapter. The vertical position measures the total number of characters."
